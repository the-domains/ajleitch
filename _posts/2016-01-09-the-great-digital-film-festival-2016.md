# THE GREAT DIGITAL FILM FESTIVAL 2016 

Just finished work on this year's campaign for Cineplex's totally radical Great Digital Film Festival. This year is geared towards the best Sci-Fi, Fantasy and Cult films. My job is to design and create everything from the web assets to the print finals. 

Here is the final poster artwork.  ![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/6c8637b164fe0b9dac99968da8427c1e98642ab8.jpg)
